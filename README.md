Institution Graduation Rate Analysis
==============================

This project focuses on College Scorecard data provided by the U.S. Department of Education. The purpose it to explore student data to find useful insights on increasing graduation rates. In particular, I'd like to see if there is statistical significance between ACT/SAT scores at admittance and graduation rate after 4 years of enrollment.
